Fix Motion fields not syncing to Notion - preserve sync flags

The issue was that upsertSyncTask was overwriting ALL fields including notion_sync_needed flag every time Notion â†’ Database sync ran. This meant Motion fields updates that set notion_sync_needed=true were immediately overwritten back to false.

Fixed by adding WHERE clause to only update when Notion data actually changes, preserving flags like notion_sync_needed that are set by other operations.
