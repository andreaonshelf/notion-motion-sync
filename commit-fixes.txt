Implement critical sync reliability fixes

Based on production issues discovered:

1. Fix "false positive" syncs
   - Only mark notion_sync_needed=false AFTER successful Notion update
   - Keep failed syncs eligible for retry

2. Add Motion scheduling data refresh
   - Check unscheduled tasks during slow sync
   - Pull scheduling data after Motion auto-scheduler runs
   - Wait 3s after task creation for Motion scheduler

3. Prevent duplicate Motion task creation
   - Check if Motion task exists by name before creating
   - Reconnect to existing tasks instead of creating duplicates

4. Add error handling to database operations
   - Log and throw errors instead of failing silently
   - Verify row updates succeeded

5. Already fixed:
   - Notion rich_text clearing (empty array vs empty string)
   - Dangerous "clear all when 0" cleanup removed

These fixes prevent cascade failures and ensure data consistency.
