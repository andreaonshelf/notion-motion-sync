Add enhanced logging to debug Motion fields sync issue

- Add detailed logging in syncDatabaseToNotion to show update payloads
- Add logging in notionClient.updateTask to show what properties are sent
- Change log level from debug to info for successful Notion updates
- Log Motion fields presence and actual values being sent

This will help identify why Motion fields aren't appearing in Notion despite being in the database.
