Fix critical database update failures and Motion ID sync issues

Root cause: Database updates were failing after Motion operations succeeded,
causing Motion IDs to be lost and tasks to be recreated with new IDs.

Fixes:
- Add proper error handling for Motion delete + database update atomicity
- Fix Notion rich_text clearing (empty array instead of empty string)  
- Remove dangerous "clear all IDs when Motion returns 0" logic
- Add Motion ID restoration endpoint to reconnect orphaned tasks
- Add diagnostic endpoints to debug Motion data

This prevents future Motion ID mismatches and provides tools to restore connections.
