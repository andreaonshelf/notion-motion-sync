Implement atomic operations with error recovery for Motion sync

Added comprehensive error recovery mechanism:

1. Created TransactionWrapper class for database transactions
   - Supports rollback on failure
   - Logs critical inconsistencies for manual recovery

2. Added executeMotionOperation helper in PollService
   - Ensures Motion operations and database updates are atomic
   - Provides rollback capability when possible
   - Logs critical failures that need manual intervention

3. Updated all Motion operations to use atomic pattern:
   - CREATE: Deletes Motion task if DB update fails
   - UPDATE: Logs failure (can't rollback Motion updates)
   - DELETE: Verifies deletion and retries DB update if needed

This prevents the cascade failures where Motion operations succeed but database updates fail, leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
